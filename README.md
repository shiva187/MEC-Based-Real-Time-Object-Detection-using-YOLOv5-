# MEC-Based-Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv5-

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a transformative technology in 5G networks that allows data processing to occur close to the data source, reducing latency and enhancing efficiency. One practical application of MEC is real-time object detection, where video feeds from devices (UEs) are analyzed on a nearby MEC server rather than in the cloud or the device itself.

This documentation outlines a setup where a webcam feed from one machine (Machine-1, the Transmitter) is transmitted to another machine (Machine-2, the MEC Server), which performs object detection using YOLOv5. The detections are then visualized through a simple web dashboard.
