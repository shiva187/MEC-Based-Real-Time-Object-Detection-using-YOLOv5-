# MEC-Based-Real-Time-Object-Detection-using-YOLOv5-

Multi-access Edge Computing (MEC) is a transformative technology in 5G networks that allows data processing to occur close to the data source, reducing latency and enhancing efficiency. One practical application of MEC is real-time object detection, where video feeds from devices (UEs) are analyzed on a nearby MEC server rather than in the cloud or the device itself.

This documentation outlines a setup where a webcam feed from one machine (Machine-1, the Transmitter) is transmitted to another machine (Machine-2, the MEC Server), which performs object detection using YOLOv5. The detections are then visualized through a simple web dashboard.

For this let us consider transmitter as Machine-1 and reciver as Machine-2

## üñ•Ô∏è System Architectur
Meachine 1 (webcam) ------> MEC server(Object Detect) ----> HTTP(Web Dashboar) -----> Infinixdb(Database)

## Transmitter Side (Machine-1)

#### Identify Available Camera Devices

```bash
ls /dev/video*
```

#### Install and Start RTSP Streaming
installation 
```bash
sudo apt install v4l2rtspserver
sudo snap connect sudo  v4l2rtspserver:camera
sudo v4l2rtspserver /dev/video0
```
Make sure the device has proper camera permissions.
    ‚Ä¢ The default RTSP URL will be: rtsp://<machine1_ip>:8554/unicast
Note: Both machines must be on the same local network.

another option use the code provided to start the rtsp server 

## MEC Server Side (Machine-2)
Requiremented Packages: 
 flask
 opencv-python-headless
 torch
 torchvision
 numpy
 matplotlib
 pillow
 scipy
 pandas

#### Install with
```bash
pip install flask torch torchvision opencv-python numpy
```

## Python Code Summary
    ‚Ä¢ Flask server to handle video uploads and stream processing.
    ‚Ä¢ YOLOv5s model from ultralytics via torch.hub.
    ‚Ä¢ stream_processor() function processes RTSP stream.
    ‚Ä¢ Captured frames with detections are stored in a detections/ folder.
    ‚Ä¢ dashboard route displays the latest 20 detections as a webpage.

RTSP Capture in Python:

‚Äúcap = cv2.VideoCapture("rtsp://192.168.0.116:8554/unicast")‚Äù
Change ip address that you got in machine one
